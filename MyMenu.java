//    The software shall implement the following items:
//
//    1 - Register Prize tickets
//    2 - List all prize tickets
//    3 - List only raffled tickets
//    4 - Create a new Oompa Loompa song
//    5 - Register Beings
//    => What does responsible for the typing mean?? Should I read from file, should I handle exception.
//    6 - Register Products
//    => Read from file.
//    7 - Ruffle tickets
//    => Ask teacher.
//    8 - Register sale 
//    => users should be storaged in HashMap/HashTable, products should be storaged in HashSet(if not exists duplicate) or HashMap(if has duplicate)
//    9 - List winners

//    Use Java.text.SimpleDateFormat for the dates formatting and parsing (if necessary)
//    Use some library for creating the random Oompa Loompa song => CLGT????????????

//    Recommendations:
//
//    if for instance the number of tickets is bigger than the number of products, it is okay to simply add the tickets to the products and inform the user, you don't need to ask the user to inform another number (unless you want);
//    You can create a class on a separated file to populate the Arrays (it will be less messy for your Main).
